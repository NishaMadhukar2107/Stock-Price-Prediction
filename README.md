This project describes about predicting stock price. First I started with importing the necessary libraries and then checking the shape of the dataset, datatypes and null values.
Null values were handled and imputed using mean. 
EDA analysis were performed for the dataset. 
Feature Engineering was done by creating a new column and scaling of the dataset was done.
Splitting of the dataset and further building the model using LSTM model.
Calculating RMSE values and visualizing the plot using matplotlib library.
